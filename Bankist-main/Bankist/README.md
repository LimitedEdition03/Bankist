# Bankist
Bankist is a basic financial tool built using Javascript and replicating some of the features that we have in a bank. We update payment, we process deposit/withdrawal and history. It also enables individuals to easily manage their finances with a range of user-friendly features and mechanisms ensuring payment systems within a digital mode.
